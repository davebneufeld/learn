Experimental learning exercises for my kids

Statically hosted at [learn.guyellisrocks.com](http://learn.guyellisrocks.com).

## Why?

* I haven't been able to find a site or app that is really simple for the kids to use.
* I want to host this statically so once loaded can be used offline.
* I want to make it open source so that other developers with kids can use and contribute to it if they want more features.

## Getting Started

After you download the project and open it in VisualStudio Code:
1. open the terminal
2. run 'npm install'
    This will take the NPM dependencies file and download all the code you will need to run the project.
3. run 'npm update'
    This is optional.This will update all the Packages in the project with new ones if possible. 
4. run 'npm start'  
    this will start running the webserver locally
5. Now, if you press To "Start Debbugging" - a browser(Chrome) is opened to the site.
