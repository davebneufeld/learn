Experimental learning exercises for my kids

Currently statically hosted at [learn.guyellisrocks.com](http://learn.guyellisrocks.com).

## Why?

* I haven't been able to find a site or app that is really simple for the kids to use.
* I want to host this statically so once loaded can be used offline.
* I want to make it open source so that other developers with kids can use and contribute to it if they want more features.
